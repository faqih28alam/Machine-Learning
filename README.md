## 📚 What You’ll Find Here

This repo is organized into several sections:

- **notebooks/** – Jupyter notebooks for different ML topics and experiments.
  - Supervised Learning
  - Unsupervised Learning
  - Deep Learning
- **projects/** – Small ML projects to apply concepts.
- **datasets/** – Sample datasets used in notebooks and projects.
- **resources/** – Recommended books, courses, articles, and cheat sheets.
- **requirements.txt** – A list of Python dependencies for reproducibility.
